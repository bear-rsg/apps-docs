# BEAR Apps Scripts

This folder contains the things necessary for script-based access to the Django database.

Please remember to set up a `local_settings.py` file in ../django/core as normal.

Files:

* `activate.sh` - create the virtualenv and/or activate it
* `framework.py` - used by other scripts to set up the environment
